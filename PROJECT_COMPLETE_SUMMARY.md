## 🎯 **KEY FEATURES**

### **🧠 AI Intelligence (NO HARDCODING)**
```javascript
// ❌ OLD WAY (Hardcoded - REMOVED)
const responses = {
  greeting: "Waalaikumsalam! Terima kasih hubungi kami...",
  pricing: "Harga package ni start dari RM500..."
};

// ✅ NEW WAY (AI Learning - IMPLEMENTED)
const learnedPatterns = await queryLearnedPatterns(intent, context, niche);
const response = generateMalaysianStyleResponse(analysis, learnedPatterns);
// AI generates content, Malaysian style guides language structure
```

### **🎯 Dynamic Niche System**
- **NO hardcoded niche names** - system learns any product dynamically
- **VITAC Intelligence**: Learns from your 500+ VITAC conversations
- **Future Ready**: EXAMA or any product can be added seamlessly
- **Independent Learning**: Each niche develops specialized expertise

### **🇲🇾 Malaysian Language Style (ONLY Structure Hardcoded)**
```javascript
// ONLY language structure is hardcoded - content is AI-generated
const styleFramework = {
  greeting: {
    opening: ["Waalaikumsalam!", "Salam!", "Hi"],
    acknowledgment: ["Terima kasih hubungi kami", "Appreciate awak reach out"],
    offer_help: ["Saya boleh bantu", "Let me help"]
  }
};
// AI picks framework elements and generates contextual content
```
