# 🧠 N8N Integration Guide for Elasticsearch Brain MCP Server

## 🎯 Overview
This guide shows how to integrate your n8n workflows with the Elasticsearch Brain MCP server for persistent AI memory across WhatsApp sales conversations.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### ✅ Required:
- N8N installed (self-hosted or N8N Cloud)
- Internet connection
- STAFF_ID for each marketer (e.g., staff-alice-123)

### 🧠 Server Information:
- **Production URL**: `https://elastic-brain-production.up.railway.app`
- **Status**: ✅ LIVE AND READY
- **Available Tools**: 32 brain tools
- **Max Connections**: 200 concurrent marketers

---

## 🚀 Step 1: No Authentication Required!

Unlike other MCP servers, the Brain MCP uses **STAFF_ID isolation** instead of authentication:

- **Marketing Team Member 1**: `/mcp/staff-alice-123`
- **Marketing Team Member 2**: `/mcp/staff-bob-456`
- **Marketing Team Member 3**: `/mcp/staff-carol-789`

Each marketer gets their own **isolated brain memory zone**.
